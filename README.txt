Important note for Buttons:

Keep in mind that in order for the Button or Button+ to respond to any of these requests they have to be in the configuration mode:

- Button: (Re-)Connect the button to a power source with the provided USB cable. Press the button and after some time it should become visible in the network.
- Button+: Open the back of the button by rotating it clockwise. Remove the batteries and reinsert them. The Button+ should now be visible.
